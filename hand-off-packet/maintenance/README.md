### Daily Tasks
1. **Backup Verification:**  

    * Check automated backup systems to ensure they are functioning correctly. Verify that data is being backed up as expected. 
     
2. **Performance Monitoring:**  

    * Monitor application and server performance metrics daily to catch and resolve issues before they escalate.  

### Weekly Tasks
1. **Security Scans:**
    * Run automated security scans to detect vulnerabilities or security breaches.  

2. **Log Review:**  

    * Review system and application logs for unusual activity or errors that could indicate potential issues.  

3. **Update Check:**  

    * Check for new updates or patches for the software and dependencies used in your application.  

### Monthly Tasks
1. **Database Optimization and Purging:**  

    * Perform routine database maintenance tasks such as indexing and query optimization to ensure efficient data retrieval.  

    * Purge outdated or unnecessary data from the database. Establish criteria for data retention (e.g., remove user data that is older than a year and no longer needed for business or legal reasons).  

2. **Test Restore of Backups:**  

    * Periodically test backup files to ensure they are not only being created but can also be restored effectively.

    * Conduct a comprehensive security audit of the entire application and infrastructure to identify and address potential security threats.  

2. **User Access Review:**  

    * Review user roles and permissions to ensure they are still appropriate. Adjust access controls as necessary to maintain security and operational efficiency.  

3. **Performance and Scalability Review:**
    * Assess the performance of the application and infrastructure. Plan scalability improvements if needed, based on growth and usage patterns.  

4. **Disaster Recovery Drill:**
    * Conduct a disaster recovery drill to test the effectiveness of your recovery plan and make adjustments based on the findings.  

### Annual Tasks  

1. **Technology Review:**  

    * Review the technology stack to determine if newer technologies could enhance performance, security, or usability.  

2. **Compliance Check:**  

    * Ensure the application complies with relevant laws, regulations, and standards, particularly those related to data privacy and security.  

3. **Documentation Update:**  

    * Update all documentation to reflect any changes or updates made throughout the year.  

### Additional Notes on Data Purging  
* **Automate Data Purging:** Automate the data purging process where feasible, ensuring that data deletion adheres to the defined retention policy without requiring manual intervention.  

* **Audit Trails:** Maintain an audit trail for data deletions.
