<h1 align="center">Tech Stack</h1>
Below is a detailed description of the technology stack for the Bamvsthewrld application, outlining the tools and technologies chosen, and the rationale behind each choice. This provides insight into how these technologies add value to the overall portfolio.

### **Application Design**
**Tools for Design:**  
* **Adobe XD**
* **Adobe Photoshop**

**Rationale:** These tools will be used to create high-fidelity prototypes and wireframes, ensuring that the user interface is both functional and visually appealing.
<br>

### **Front-End Framework:**  
* **React**  

**Rationale:** Continuing with React for front-end development complements the existing static website's architecture and enhances it with interactive elements.

### **Styling Libraries:**

* **Styled Components:** Allows for CSS-in-JS styling, providing scoped and reusable styles.  

* **Framer Motion:** Offers powerful animation tools to enrich the user interface with smooth transitions.  

* **React Scroll:** Enhances the scrolling experience with animated view transitions.
<br>

### **State Management**
**Solution:** Redux for global state management, Context API for localized states.

**Rationale:** Redux will manage the app's state globally where needed, while React's Context API will handle state more locally within components without prop drilling.
<br>

### **Backend Framework:** Node with Express
* **Node:** Serves the API and the front-end using best practices.  

* **Express:** Handles middleware, routes, and controllers efficiently, simplifying the creation and management of RESTful API endpoints.

### **Database Management:** 
* **MongoDB with Mongoose**  

* **MongoDB/Mongoose:** Chosen for its schema-less nature, which is ideal for the flexible data requirements of the project.  

### **Operations:**  
CRUD operations, data validation to ensure integrity and accuracy of the user data.
<br>

### **Cloud Services:**  

* **Cloudinary:** Integrated for media management solutions, allowing efficient upload, storage, and optimization of images and videos.

**Rationale:** Reduces the complexity of handling media on the server-side, enhances performance with optimized media delivery.
<br>

### **Additional Tools and Libraries:**
* **Tailwind CSS:** For utility-first CSS management, enabling rapid UI development with consistent design throughout the application.  

* **Three.js:** To incorporate 3D elements into the user interface, providing a dynamic, engaging user experience.  

### **Change Order**
This document confirms the project scope for Bamvsthewrld's EPK application. Here are some proposed changes to the original scope and tech stack, reflecting the project's current direction and requirements:

* **Branding Update:** Align the application’s visual identity with Bamvsthewrld's new branding.
